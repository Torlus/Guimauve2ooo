Guimauve 2ooo - VGA output for Apple //c computers.

Here are the schematics and VHDL code for this adapter.
The board itself is awfully designed.

I'm releasing it for people that were interested in purchasing the board, as I don't plan to assemble new ones.
Feel free to contact me if you have some questions to ask about it.
